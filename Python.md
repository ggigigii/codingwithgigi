# Projects

During my final undergraduate year at Simon Fraser University (Vancouver), I developed a passion for data manipulation and exploratory analysis through my honors econometric seminar. My term project involved using a regression discontinuity design (RDD) to examine different impacts of exogenous variables on the effects of religiousness. Since my paper diverted from typical fixed-effects and random-effects models covered in the class, I was challenged by independently reviewing the RDD method to present analyses with the provided data.
