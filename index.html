        		<h1>Welcome to my home page, my name is Gigi!</h1>
				<p>I am currently a Masters of Economics student studying at the University of Toronto. 
					As I progress through learning different languages and platforms, I'd like to showcase what I have done. There may be mistakes as I am still a growing and learning student, so proceed with caution. As John Holt once said "Learning is not the product of teaching. Learning is the product of the activity of learners." Cheers!</a></p>
