## Welcome to my GitHub Page!



I am currently a graduate student pursuing my Masters in Economics at the University of Toronto in Toronto, Ontario. Recently having completed a Joint Honors in Economics and Finance from Simon Fraser University in Vancouver (BC), pursuing a Masters degree seemed like the logical next step. My interests lie in financial economics and econometric methods.

This website will be mainly used to present coursework covered in my wide array of field courses and core classes.
